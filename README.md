# FACT-AI-project
Paper reproduction for FACT-AI course at UvA.


The code associated with the paper (https://github.com/ahmadkhajehnejad/CrossWalk) contains a fork of the original implementation of Deepwalk on the github (https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk/) by an author of the original paper on Deepwalk (https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652). The fork is messy, it doesn't work out of the box and it is not yet clear that is necessary, so one may want to use the original implementation instead. That code does however not have correctly documented instructions on which versions of python and packages to use, so here are brief instructions for getting it work based on the original README.rst and experimentation with different versions of the packages. We chose to find a working combination of old packages instead of trying to make the code compatible with the newest versions of the modules.

clone https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk.git and go to the dir

$conda create -n dpwalk python=3.6

$conda activate dpwalk

change requirements.txt to: 
wheel>=0.23.0
Cython>=0.20.2
six>=1.7.3
gensim==1.0.0
scipy==1.2.0
psutil>=2.1.1
networkx>=2.0

$pip install -r requirements.txt

'$conda list' should give something like this:

FILE PATH NAMING CONVENTIONS MAY STILL CHANGE. CROSS CHECK WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF OUR CODE
In general:
$deepwalk --input {INPUT_PATH(.links)} --format edgelist --output {OUTPUT(.embeddings)}

For example for the second synthetic dataset (note that the file path may have changed when you read this):
$deepwalk --input ../data/synthetic_n500_Pred0.7_Phom0.025_Phet0.001.links --format edgelist --output synth2_deepwalk_perozzi.embeddings
You should now have a file 'synth2_deepwalk_perozzi.embeddings' in the dir
